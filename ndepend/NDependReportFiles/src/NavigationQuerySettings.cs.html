While it\'s fine to have a single instance of a class at runtime, using this pattern to enforce a single instance at test-time is problematic, as different tests may require their own instances."},{"line":"11","ruleId":"ND1313","debt":"16min","severity":"2","expl":"The <i>structure NavigationQuerySettings</i> should override the <i>Equals()</i> and <i>GetHashCode()</i> methods. Additionally, consider implementing the <i>==</i> and <i>!=</i> operators if you anticipate users comparing or sorting instances or using them as keys in hash tables. Alternatively transform it into a <i>record struct</i>."},{"line":"26","ruleId":"ND1805","debt":"1min  40s","severity":"1","expl":"The <i>field FindNearestPolyExtent</i> is used outside its parent type by the <i>2 methods Raycast(…) and TryFindPath(…)</i>.
